            Porsche is a renowned German automobile manufacturer with an<br><br> 
            emphasis in high-performance luxury sports cars, SUVs and sedans.<br><br>
            Founded by Ferdinand Porsche in 1931, what started as a development<br><br> 
            work and consulting turned into the first Porsche, the Porsche 64<br><br> 
            in 1939 after their success in designing the original Volkswagen Beetle.<br><br> 
            The first Porsche donned the Porsche’s company logo, the coat of arms of<br><br> 
            the Free People’s State of Württemberg of Weimar Germany. Porsche has<br><br> 
            continued to innovate and pay homage to the original classic through its<br><br> 
            design accents and curves, Porsche’s current lineup includes the 718 Boxster,<br><br> 
            Cayman, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne and the newest all-electric line of Taycans.
